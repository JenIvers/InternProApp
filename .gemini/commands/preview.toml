Follow these steps to deploy a preview:
1. Run `git status` and `git diff HEAD` to understand the changes.
2. Propose a concise, high-quality commit message based on the changes.
3. Once the user confirms or provides a message, run:
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "[message]"`
   - `git push origin main`
4. Remind the user that the preview URL will be available in the GitHub Actions logs or as a PR comment if applicable.
