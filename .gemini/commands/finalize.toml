Follow these steps to finalize and deploy to production:
1. Ensure the working directory is clean (`git status`). If not, suggest running `/preview` first.
2. Check for the latest tag using `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` (handle the case where no tags exist).
3. Suggest a new version tag (e.g., incrementing the patch version of the latest tag, or starting with `v1.0.0`).
4. Once the user confirms the tag name, run:
   - `git tag [tag_name]`
   - `git push origin [tag_name]`
5. Confirm that this will trigger the production deployment workflow.
